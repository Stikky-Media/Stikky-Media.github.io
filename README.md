# Stikky Developer Docs

## Getting Started

This is a documentation site for keeping track of internal dev topics and information found while digging in to topics.

### Tech Stack
The site is powered by VuePress, which takes markdown files, builds the site, and deploys to github pages.

### Writing Markdown Content
To add content, all that is required is to create a markdown file in the root directory. Whatever it is named will show up on the left sidebar, once finished writing, commit it to the `master` branch & github actions will publish it for you.

### Shopify CLI
Shopify CLI can be used to push and pull theme files from a shopify store you're working on.

It can also run a local dev server for you which will automatically pull in data from the store you're working on, so you get local development with hot-reload & accurate data.
